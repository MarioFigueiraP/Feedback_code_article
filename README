This repository contains the code used for the article Bayesian feedback in the framework of ecological sciences.

The repository includes a folder with functions to run the `Main_code_feedback.R` file, which allows reproducing the simulated results presented in the article. The various files include brief descriptions detailing the procedures throughout the code.

In particular, the different scripts are summarized below as a brief introduction to them.

  1. `Main_code_feedback.R`: This script contains the code to define the parameters that characterize the different scenarios, along with the function for executing the analyses and the feedback between models. In this process, functions defined in other scripts are called. These scripts are located in the functions folder.

  2. `dependent_model.R`: This script defines the function for analyzing dependent data using the preferential model.

  3. `fb_dependent_model.R`: This script defines the function for analyzing dependent data using a preferential model with feedback.

  4. `fb_independent_model.R`: This script defines the function for analyzing independent data using a geostatistical model with feedback.

  5. `independent_model.R`: This script defines the function for analyzing independent data using a geostatistical model.

  6. `sampling_functions.R`: This script defines the functions for the different sampling processes.

  7. `several_functions.R`: This script defines various general-purpose functions.

  8. `simulation_function.R`: This script defines the function for simulating the underlying biomass process, given the parameters that characterize each scenario.
