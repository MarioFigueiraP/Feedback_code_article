# This script defines the structure for implementing the independent model with feedback, with covariates, and the spatial effect.
# Therefore, as with the independent model without feedback, part of the script is dedicated to constructing the mesh required for the SPDE-FEM approach to analyze the spatial structure. 
# The necessary procedures to approximate the likelihood of the LGCP process, as described in Simpson et al. (2016), ['Going off grid: computationally efficient inference for log-Gaussian Cox processes'], are also followed."
# Since we are going to implement the feedback procedure, we will have some code related to the redefinition of the prior distributions.
